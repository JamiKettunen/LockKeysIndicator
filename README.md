# LockKeysIndicator
A Windows program to indicate lock key eg. caps lock state changes visually.

## Features
* Tray icon with status info on hover
* All options in tray right-click menu
* Configurable indicator location including active, primary and specified screen
* Localization support via my own localization framework (an older revision used here)
* Indicator toggleable for all lock keys individually or all at once
* Effect toggles (fade, transparency & blending) for the indicator
* Limited custom theming via resource editing in the project
* Passes clicks through the indicator Form like it should :)
* Auto-starting with Windows
* Simple about window
